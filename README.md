 ðŸ’³ Credit Card Spend Analytics (SQL + Python)

 ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes credit card transaction data to uncover spending habits, city-wise contributions, gender-based patterns, and more.  
It combines the power of SQL for data querying and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

The goal is to simulate a **real-world Data Analyst workflow**:
- Clean & query the dataset using **SQL**
- Perform EDA and generate insights using **Python**
- Visualize spending behavior with interactive charts
