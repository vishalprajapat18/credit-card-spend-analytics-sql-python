 💳 Credit Card Spend Analytics (SQL + Python)

 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes credit card transaction data to uncover spending habits, city-wise contributions, gender-based patterns, and more.  
It combines the power of SQL for data querying and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

The goal is to simulate a **real-world Data Analyst workflow**:
- Clean & query the dataset using **SQL**
- Perform EDA and generate insights using **Python**
- Visualize spending behavior with interactive charts

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **SQL (Microsoft SQL Server / MySQL)** – querying & transformations  
- **Python** – data cleaning, EDA, visualization  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express

## 📊 Key Insights & Queries
### SQL Queries
1. Top 5 cities with highest credit card spends and their % contribution  
2. Highest spend month per card type  
3. First transaction when each card type reached **1M cumulative spend**  
4. City with **lowest % spend** for Gold cards  
5. City-wise **highest & lowest expense type**  
6. Female spending contribution across categories  
7. Card + expense type with highest month-over-month growth  
8. Weekend spend-to-transaction ratio by city  
9. City that reached **500th transaction the fastest**
